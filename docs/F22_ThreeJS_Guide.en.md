# F-22 Raptor — glTF → Three.js Integration Guide

How to export `F22.blend` as glTF/GLB and drive its animation + textures yourself in Three.js.

Every number here was read from the actual file (`F22.blend`, Blender 5.2.0 LTS) and from a **real test export** whose GLB was then inspected. Nothing is guessed.

## 1. Model overview

| item | value |
|---|---|
| Main file | `F22.blend` |
| Blender | 5.2.0 LTS |
| Objects | 277 (265 meshes) |
| Triangles | ~39,040 |
| Materials | 7 |
| Armatures (rigs) | 9 |
| Scene FPS | **24** |
| Animation clips | 10 (open-only, reversible — §3) |
| Showcase timeline | frame 1 – 972 (40.5 s), reference only |
| Unit scale | 1.0 |
| Bounding box | X 4.29 × Y 3.10 × Z 1.06 (Blender units) |
| Textures | 28 PNG, ~85 MB total (`textures/`) |
| GLB (textures embedded) | 53.52 MB, 19 images, 10 clips |
| GLB (no textures) | 2.22 MB |

**Scale:** the real jet is 18.92 m long; the model is 4.29 units → multiply by **4.41** for meters.
(Or leave it and scale camera/physics to model units — just pick one and stick with it.)

**Axes:** Blender is Z-up, glTF/Three.js is Y-up. Conversion is `(x, y, z)_blender → (x, z, -y)_three`.

| direction | Blender | Three.js |
|---|---|---|
| Nose | +X | **+X** |
| Right wing | −Y | **+Z** |
| Left wing | +Y | −Z |
| Up | +Z | **+Y** |

So in Three.js: **roll = X axis, yaw = Y axis, pitch = Z axis.**

### 1.1 Object naming

Every part has been renamed systematically (from originals like `Fuselage.047`, `bLGrack.L.023`).
All 278 old→new mappings live in `F22_rename_map.json`; the revert script is `F22_revert_rename.py`.

Prefixes in use:

| prefix | meaning | approx count |
|---|---|---|
| `Body_`, `Wing_`, `Tail_` | structure + control surfaces | 15 |
| `MLG_*` | main landing gear, left/right | 56 |
| `NLG_*` | nose landing gear | 17 |
| `Bay_*` | weapon bays, doors, rails | 37 |
| `Flare_Dispenser_*` | flare dispenser doors + pins, L/R | 8 |
| `Canopy_*` | canopy assembly | 5 |
| `Cockpit_*`, `Seat_*` | interior | 90 |
| `Engine_Nozzle_*` | exhaust nozzles (thrust vectoring) | 9 |
| `Hook_*` | tailhook | 7 |
| `Wpn_*` | AIM-120 ×6, AIM-9M ×2 | 8 |
| `Light_*` | taxi / formation lights | 5 |
| `RIG_*` | armatures (no mesh) | 9 |

## 2. Rig architecture — read this before writing code

**Key idea: control mechanisms, not parts.**

The left main gear has 28 parts (strut, drag brace, upper/lower torque links, three door links, actuator rod, brake disc, wheel…) — and **you touch none of them**. Every part is parented to a bone of `RIG_MainGear_L`, and every bone is keyed. Play one clip and the whole linkage follows.

The part tables below are **reference material** (for hiding parts, swapping materials, raycasting), not a list of things you must animate.

### 2.1 Facts established by the test export

1. **You get 10 AnimationClips**, named after the *mechanism*, not the armature: `Canopy_Open`, `WeaponBay_Main_L_Open`, `WeaponBay_Main_R_Open`, `WeaponBay_Side_L_Open`, `WeaponBay_Side_R_Open`, `FlareDispenser_L_Open`, `FlareDispenser_R_Open`, `LandingGear_Deploy`, `Tailhook_Deploy`, `Aero_Demo` (§3).
2. Each clip starts at **0 s**, runs closed → open, and carries tracks **only for the bones of its own mechanism**. `LandingGear_Deploy` is the one clip that spans several armatures (nose + both mains) — by design.
3. **0 skinned meshes** — every mesh is a plain node parented under a bone node ⇒ you can write transforms directly onto nodes (spin wheels, deflect control surfaces) with no skinning involved.
4. `track time = frame / 24` exactly → 24 source frames = 1 s.

### 2.2 rig → bone → mesh

`RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` (23 bones) — the catch-all rig: tailhook + control surfaces + nozzles.

| bone | attached parts | group |
|---|---|---|
| `Bone` | `Hook_Pivot` | tailhook |
| `Bone.003` | `Hook_Trunnion` | tailhook |
| `Bone.022` | `Hook_Shank_Upper`, `Hook_Shank_Arm`, `Hook_Point`, `Hook_Actuator` | tailhook (unkeyed — rides its parent) |
| `Bone.001` / `Bone.002` | `Tail_InterNozzle_Panel_L` / `_R` | inter-nozzle panels — **move with the hook** |
| `Bone.004` / `Bone.005` | `Tail_Stabilator_R` / `_L` | pitch |
| `Bone.006` / `Bone.007` | `Tail_VerticalFin_R` / `_L` | rudder (yaw) |
| `Bone.008` / `Bone.009` | `Wing_Flaperon_R` / `_L` | pitch + roll |
| `Bone.010` / `Bone.011` | `Wing_LEFlap_R` / `_L` | leading-edge flap |
| `Bone.012` / `Bone.013` | `Wing_Aileron_R` / `_L` | roll |
| `Bone.014` `.016` | upper nozzle flap R / L | thrust vectoring |
| `Bone.018` `.020` | lower nozzle flap R / L | thrust vectoring |
| `Bone.015` `.017` | upper nozzle vane R / L | |
| `Bone.019` `.021` | lower nozzle vane R / L | |

`RIG_MainGear_L` / `_R` (23 bones per side) — main parts:

| bone | parts |
|---|---|
| `Bone.008` | `MLG_x_Strut_Main` (+ Detail_01/05) |
| `Bone.014` | `MLG_Wheel_x`, `MLG_x_BrakeDisc`, `MLG_x_AxleFork` |
| `Bone.019` | `MLG_x_Door`, `MLG_x_DoorActuator`, `MLG_x_DoorLink_02` |
| `Bone` | `MLG_x_DragBrace`, `MLG_x_UpperLink` |
| `Bone.011` / `.012` | `MLG_x_TorqueLink_Upper` / `_Lower` |
| `Bone.006` | `MLG_x_Trunnion` |
| `Bone.010` | `MLG_x_SideBrace` |
| `Bone.009` | `MLG_x_BayFairing` |
| rest | `MLG_x_Detail_01..10`, `DoorLink_01/03`, `Pin_01`, `ActuatorRod`, `ShockCollar`, `UpperFitting` |

`RIG_NoseGear` (12 bones)

| bone | parts |
|---|---|
| `Bone.005` | `NLG_Strut_Outer`, **`Light_Taxi_L`, `Light_Taxi_R`** (taxi lights ride the nose strut) |
| `Bone.002` | `NLG_Strut_Inner`, `NLG_Wheel` |
| `Bone.009` | `NLG_Pivot_Pin`, `NLG_TorqueLink` |
| `Bone.003` | `NLG_LockLink_Upper/Mid/Lower` |
| `Bone.001` | `NLG_RetractActuator` |
| `Bone` | `NLG_DragBrace` |
| `Bone.007` / `.008` | nose gear doors R / L (`NLG_Door_Rail_x` + 3 hinge pins) |
| `Control` | control bone |

`RIG_Bay_L` / `_R` (renamed from `RIG_BayDoor_Center_x`) — **three independent mechanisms on one rig**, split by bone into three clips:

| bone | parts | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `Bone.002` | `Bay_Center_Door_x` + frame + hinge rod | lower (main) bay — **the only keyed bone** |
| `Bone.003` | center door edge / seal / seam / strip | child of `Bone.002`, **no keys** |
| `Bone.010` / `.011` | `Bay_Center_Door_Rib_x_Inner` / `_Outer` | child of `Bone.002`, **no keys** |
| `Bone.004` | `Bay_Center_Door_Seal_Fwd` (**R rig only**; unused on L) | **static**, no keys |
| `Bone` | `Bay_Side_Door_x_Inner` + lower frame + hinge rod | side bay |
| `Bone.001` | `Bay_Side_Door_x_Outer` + upper frame + hinge rod | side bay |
| `Bone.008` | `Flare_Dispenser_x_Upper` (+ pin) | flare dispenser |
| `Bone.009` | `Flare_Dispenser_x_Lower` (+ pin) | flare dispenser |

> The two flare dispenser doors used to be called `Bay_Side_DoorHingeArm_x` / `Bay_Center_DoorHingeArm_x`. They are not hinge arms: they are two ~11 cm boxes sitting **0.43 units aft of the side bay**, on their own hinges, with their own travel (74° / 68° vs the doors' 90° / 120°). Renamed for accuracy.

> **Main bay door history.** `Bone.003`, `.010`, `.011` and `.004` each used to carry their own rotation keys (129.8° / 122.4° / 112.4° / 180°), and `.003`→`.010` were chained so the angles stacked. The door leaf therefore tore away from its own edge trim and ribs while swinging — the distance between `Bay_Center_Door_L` and its trim pieces drifted by 29.9–77.7 mm between closed and open, leaving the trim across the bay mouth and making the bay look like it never opened fully.
>
> Fixed: `Bone.011` reparented under `Bone.002`, all keys on the four bones deleted (40 fcurves per clip), `Bone.004` made static. The whole door assembly now swings rigidly on `Bone.002` at 119.8° — drift is **0.00 mm** on every pair, and BVH shows no intersection with the skin at the open frame. The side bay and flare doors never had this problem (0.00 mm drift already) and were left alone.

`RIG_Trapeze_L` / `_R` (renamed from `RIG_BayDoor_Side_x`) — AIM-9 trapeze launcher

| bone | parts |
|---|---|
| `Bone.007` | `Bay_Side_LauncherRail_x`, **`Wpn_AIM9M_x`** |
| `Bone.005` / `.006` | `Bay_Side_LauncherArm_x_Aft` / `_Fwd` |

`RIG_Canopy`

| bone | parts |
|---|---|
| `Bone` | `Canopy_Glass`, `Canopy_Frame_Rear`, `Canopy_Actuator` |
| `Bone.001` | `Canopy_Hinge_Arm` |
| `Bone.002` | `Canopy_Hinge_Bracket` |

## 3. Animation clips

The blend ships **10 actions, one per mechanism**. Every clip is an *opening* motion:

```
first frame                 last frame
CLOSED / REST  ──────────▶  OPEN
                 reverse ◀
```

There is **no closing clip** — play the same action backwards (`timeScale = -1`, §6.2).

| action / clip | what moves | rig(s) driven | animated nodes | duration | source frames |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Canopy_Open` | canopy up + hinge arm/bracket | `RIG_Canopy` | 3 | 2.708 s | 842 – 907 |
| `WeaponBay_Main_L_Open` | **lower (main) bay door, left** — the whole door assembly (trim and ribs ride along, no nodes of their own) | `RIG_Bay_L` | 1 | 1.500 s | 221 – 257 |
| `WeaponBay_Main_R_Open` | **lower (main) bay door, right** — the whole door assembly | `RIG_Bay_R` | 1 | 1.500 s | 221 – 257 |
| `WeaponBay_Side_L_Open` | **left side bay: both door halves + AIM-9 swings out** on its trapeze | `RIG_Bay_L`, `RIG_Trapeze_L` | 6 | 1.167 s | 221 – 249 |
| `WeaponBay_Side_R_Open` | **right side bay: both door halves + AIM-9 swings out** | `RIG_Bay_R`, `RIG_Trapeze_R` | 6 | 1.167 s | 221 – 249 |
| `FlareDispenser_L_Open` | left flare dispenser doors (upper + lower) | `RIG_Bay_L` | 2 | 1.250 s | 221 – 251 |
| `FlareDispenser_R_Open` | right flare dispenser doors (upper + lower) | `RIG_Bay_R` | 2 | 1.250 s | 221 – 251 |
| `LandingGear_Deploy` | nose gear + both main gears down | `RIG_NoseGear`, `RIG_MainGear_L`, `RIG_MainGear_R` | 46 | 4.167 s | 741 – 841 |
| `Tailhook_Deploy` | hook down + inter-nozzle panels | `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` (`Bone`, `.001`, `.002`, `.003`) | 4 | 3.167 s | 764 – 840 |
| `Aero_Demo` | control-surface + thrust-vectoring showcase | `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` (`Bone.004` – `.021`) | 18 | 16.208 s | 345 – 734 |

Guarantees, all checked against the exported GLB (`export/F22_master.glb`):

1. Each clip carries tracks **only** for the bones of its own mechanism. Pairwise node overlap between the 10 clips is **0** ⇒ any combination may play simultaneously and they can never fight each other. The three mechanisms that share `RIG_Bay_L` (main bay / side bay / flare) are fully independent.
2. No clip animates an armature object node or a rig it doesn't own.
3. Every clip starts at **t = 0 s**; `duration = (lastFrame − firstFrame) / 24`.
4. Frame 0 of each clip is the same pose as the closed/rest state of that mechanism in the showcase; the last frame is fully open. Worst world-space deviation from the Blender source: **1 µm**.

Gotchas:

* **Each bay clip is self-contained.** `WeaponBay_Side_L_Open` opens the side bay doors *and* swings the AIM-9 out (the doors live on `RIG_Bay_L`, the trapeze on `RIG_Trapeze_L`; the clip spans both). `WeaponBay_Main_L_Open` opens only the lower bay door. Neither carries any flare dispenser track.
* `Bay_Center_Door_Seal_Fwd` is a single part spanning the full bay width at the forward bulkhead (X `0.504–0.516`, Y `−0.195…+0.195`) — **not part of either door leaf**. It used to be keyed to flip 180°; it is now static and does not move in any clip.
* `LandingGear_Deploy` covers all three legs in one clip (nose leads, mains follow — that offset is baked in). `t = 0` is gear **up**, `t = duration` is gear **down**.
* `Aero_Demo` is eye candy. In a game, drive those surfaces yourself (§7.1) — it is a separate clip precisely so it never touches the hook.
* The glTF rest pose (Blender frame 1) is gear **down**, canopy **open**, hook **retracted**, bays **closed**. That is still not the state you want everywhere, so set every mechanism explicitly at load (§6.3).

### 3.1 The original showcase timeline (reference only)

The single `Scene` action is still in the .blend (fake user, unassigned, **not exported**). The clips above were cut from it using the ranges in this table.

> ⚠️ **Do not delete the `Scene` action.** It is the source `F22_build_anim_clips.py` builds from (`SRC_NAME = "Scene"` plus the `RIG_SLOT` map onto slots `OBArmature.00x`). Delete it and the script cannot run.
>
> The tailhook keys in it (`Bone`, `.001`, `.002`, `.003` under slot `OBArmature.001`) were remapped `q' = q_retracted⁻¹ · q` to match the new rest pose. If you ever restore `Scene` from an older backup, remap it again before rebuilding.
>
> The old `Bone.003` / `.010` / `.011` / `.004` keys under slots `OBArmature.004` / `.006` (left/right bay) are still in there. `F22_build_anim_clips.py` filters them out (`BAY_MAIN_BONES = {"Bone.002"}`), but assigning `Scene` directly for playback will now double-rotate `Bone.011`, which is a child of `Bone.002`.

`t = frame / 24`

| # | move | frames | seconds | clip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Canopy close** | 8 – 70 | 0.333 – 2.917 | `RIG_Canopy` |
| 2 | **Main gear up** | 111 – 181 | 4.625 – 7.542 | `RIG_MainGear_L`, `_R` |
| 3 | **Tailhook retract** | 116 – 188 | 4.833 – 7.833 | `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` |
| 4 | **Nose gear up** | 172 – 214 | 7.167 – 8.917 | `RIG_NoseGear` |
| 5 | **Weapon bay open** | 221 – 261 | 9.208 – 10.875 | `RIG_Bay_L/R` |
| 5b | ↳ AIM-9 trapeze extends | 236 – 249 | 9.833 – 10.375 | `RIG_Trapeze_L/R` |
| 6 | **Weapon bay close** | 301 – 342 | 12.542 – 14.250 | `RIG_Bay_L/R` |
| 6b | ↳ AIM-9 trapeze retracts | 313 – 326 | 13.042 – 13.583 | `RIG_Trapeze_L/R` |
| 7 | **Aero demo** (control surfaces + thrust vectoring) | 345 – 734 | 14.375 – 30.583 | `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` |
| 8 | **Nose gear down** | 741 – 781 | 30.875 – 32.542 | `RIG_NoseGear` |
| 9 | **Tailhook deploy** | 764 – 840 | 31.833 – 35.000 | `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` |
| 10 | **Main gear down** | 771 – 841 | 32.125 – 35.042 | `RIG_MainGear_L`, `_R` |
| 11 | **Canopy open** | 842 – 907 | 35.083 – 37.792 | `RIG_Canopy` |

⚠️ **Left and right bay doors are not keyed identically** — Center_L is 221–257, Center_R is 221–261; on closing, Center_R is 301–342 and Center_L is 305–342.
Cutting each side to its own numbers leaves one door ajar. **Use the union range 221–261 / 301–342 for both sides.**

Aero demo (row 7) broken down:

| frame range | what moves |
|---|---|
| 345 – 499 | rudders (`Tail_VerticalFin_L/R`) sweep |
| 351 – 530 | LE flaps + flaperons, first pass |
| 381 – 541 | stabilator pitch |
| 381 – 700 | upper/lower nozzle flaps — pitch vectoring, then differential (L/R opposed) |
| 542 – 700 | aileron roll |
| 560 – 734 | LE flaps + flaperons, second pass |

Measured values: nozzles deflect to **+16° / −20°** in pitch; from frame 542 onward left and right deflect in opposite directions (roll vectoring).

**State at frame 1:** canopy open (−20°), gear down, **hook retracted**, bays closed.

The hook flipped from deployed to retracted when the rest pose was rebuilt (see §3.3). Canopy and gear are still in their open/down poses, so state still has to be set explicitly at load (see §6.3).

### 3.2 Regenerating the clips

`F22_build_anim_clips.py` rebuilds all 10 actions from the `Scene` action and pushes each one onto its own NLA track (the tracks are muted so the viewport stays clean — muting a *track* does not stop the exporter). It is idempotent: run it again and it deletes and rebuilds the clips.

```python
exec(open("/path/to/F22/F22_build_anim_clips.py").read())
```

Edit the `CLIPS` table at the top of that file to change a range or add a mechanism.

⚠️ **Re-running deletes the existing clips and rebuilds them from `Scene`.** Before you run it, check that `BAY_MAIN_BONES = {"Bone.002"}` (§2.2) and that the hook keys inside `Scene` have been remapped (§3.1) — otherwise you bring back both the torn main bay door and a tailhook keyed against the wrong rest pose.

### 3.3 Tailhook — the rest pose was swapped to retracted

**Symptom:** load the GLB on the web and the tailhook is already hanging out before any clip has played. Playing `Tailhook_Deploy` looks like it barely moves, and "retract" puts it right back where it started.

**Cause:** the rest pose of `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` matched the **last** frame of the clip exactly — bbox centres gave `d(rest, f76) = 0.00 mm` on all 8 parts, with the retracted pose sitting at f0, 174.6 mm away. glTF writes the bind pose from the rest pose, so loading the model *is* the deployed pose, and resetting to bind pose deploys it again.

**Fix:** applied the f0 pose as the rest pose for 5 bones (`Bone`, `Bone.001`, `Bone.002`, `Bone.003`, **`Bone.022`** — `.022` has to be included because it carries the shank, point and actuator), then rewrote all 16 quaternion fcurves as `q' = q_f0⁻¹ · q`, baked on every frame 0–76.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| rest pose | deployed (= f76) | **retracted (= f0)** |
| `d(rest, f0)` | 174.6 mm | **0.00 mm** |
| `d(rest, f76)` | 0.00 mm | **174.6 mm** |
| actual travel | 174.55 mm | 174.55 mm (unchanged) |

World positions at f0 / f38 / f76 differ from the originals by at most **0.0004 mm** — the motion is identical, only the reference pose moved.

Clip direction is unchanged: `t = 0` is **retracted**, `t = duration` is **deployed**.

### 3.4 Trap: the Action Editor silently assigns actions

If the Action Editor is open and not pinned 📌, Blender assigns whatever action it is showing to the next object you click. An active action **overrides the entire NLA stack**, so your tracks stop having any effect, and the stray action gets saved into the file.

Seen for real in this project: `RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook` was left holding `FlareDispenser_L_Open`, so the hook bones were never animated at all and sat at rest; and the meshes `Bay_Side_DoorFrame_L_Upper` / `Flare_Dispenser_L_Lower` were holding armature actions (a mesh with `pose.bones[...]` fcurves does nothing, but it breaks the glTF export).

Check before every export:

```python
import bpy
print("stray active actions:",
      [(o.name, o.animation_data.action.name)
       for o in bpy.data.objects
       if o.animation_data and o.animation_data.action])
print("mesh with anim data:",
      [o.name for o in bpy.data.objects
       if o.type == 'MESH' and o.animation_data])
```

Both lines must print `[]`.

### 3.5 `PlayClip.py` — preview one clip at a time in Blender

The .blend carries a text block called `PlayClip.py` (fake user). Set `CLIP = "..."` on the top line and hit **Alt+P**. It will:

* clear the active action on every object (the §3.4 problem)
* unmute only the NLA tracks holding a strip of that clip, mute everything else
* set `frame_start` / `frame_end` to the clip's range and jump to the first frame

`CLIP = "*"` unmutes everything. A wrong name prints the list of valid ones.

It matters because clips spanning multiple rigs (`WeaponBay_Side_L_Open` lives on both `RIG_Bay_L` and `RIG_Trapeze_L`) need the ★ solo toggled on each rig separately — miss one and the doors open while the AIM-9 arm stays put.

## 4. Exporting from Blender

### 4.1 The recipe that was tested and works (recommended — textures embedded)

Run from Blender's Scripting tab (or via MCP):

```python
import bpy, os

OUT = "/path/to/your/game/public/models"
os.makedirs(OUT, exist_ok=True)

# Deterministic rest pose: no action assigned, every pose bone at rest.
for o in (x for x in bpy.data.objects if x.type == 'ARMATURE'):
    for pb in o.pose.bones:
        pb.matrix_basis.identity()
bpy.context.scene.frame_set(1)

bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(
    filepath=os.path.join(OUT, "F22_master.glb"),
    export_format='GLB',
    export_image_format='AUTO',          # embed textures in the file
    export_animations=True,
    export_animation_mode='ACTIONS',     # one glTF animation per action
    export_merge_animation='ACTION',     # merge same-named actions across armatures
    export_anim_slide_to_zero=True,      # every clip starts at t = 0 s
    export_force_sampling=True,
    export_optimize_animation_size=True,
    export_optimize_animation_keep_anim_armature=False,  # ⚠️ see below
    export_frame_range=False,            # ⚠️ scene range starts at 1, clips start at 0
    export_bake_animation=False,
    export_def_bones=False,              # ⚠️ must be False or all non-deform bones are dropped
    export_apply=False,
    use_selection=False,
    export_cameras=False,
    export_lights=False,
    export_yup=True,
)
```

Actual result: **53.52 MB**, 265 meshes, 385 nodes, 7 materials, 19 images, **10 animations**, 0 skinned meshes (~6 s).

This is the **master** file — unoptimized. Never ship it directly; run it through §10 first.

Three flags decide whether the clips stay independent:

| flag | why |
|---|---|
| `export_optimize_animation_keep_anim_armature=False` | **The important one.** Left at its default `True`, the exporter writes a track for *every* bone of an armature the clip touches — `Tailhook_Deploy` would then also pin all 18 wing/nozzle bones and fight `Aero_Demo`. With `False`, bones that aren't animated by the action are dropped, and bones that *are* keyed keep their tracks (2 keys if they hold still). Verified: node overlap between the clips drops from 23 to 0. |
| `export_animation_mode='ACTIONS'` + `export_merge_animation='ACTION'` | Each action becomes one glTF animation with the action's name; the three gear armatures that share `LandingGear_Deploy` merge into a single animation instead of three. |
| `export_frame_range=False` | The scene range starts at frame 1, the clips at frame 0. Leaving this `True` clips the first frame of every animation. |

> `export_def_bones=True` strips bones without vertex groups. This rig is pure bone-parenting with zero deform bones — so that flag wipes out every animation.

> The rigs keep **no active action** — the clips live on muted NLA tracks (§3.2). Don't re-assign the `Scene` action before exporting, or you'll get a 9th, 40-second animation that keys everything.

### 4.2 What the exporter does to textures automatically

The 26 PNGs in `textures/` collapse to **19 images** because the exporter packs them:

| what the exporter does | result |
|---|---|
| **Packs Metallic + Roughness into one ORM texture** (G = roughness, B = metallic) | `Cabin_Metallic-Cabin_Roughness`, `Landing_gear_Metallic-Landing_gear_Roughness`, … |
| **Merges Opacity into the base color's alpha channel** | `Cabin_Base_color-Cabin_Opacity`, `Landing_gear_Base_color-Landing_gear_Opacity` |
| Sets `alphaMode: MASK` on materials with opacity | `Interior_Cockpit_Bays`, `LandingGear` (cutoff defaults to 0.5) |
| Drops `Cockpit_+_details_Height.png` | not wired into the node tree |

`Airframe_Exterior` has no roughness file, so the exporter writes metallic into channel B, leaves G at white (255), and sets `roughnessFactor: 0.5` ⇒ a constant roughness of 0.5 across the airframe, matching Blender.

**So once loaded into Three.js the materials are ready to use** — no manual texture wiring needed (except the canopy, see §9).

### 4.3 Alternative — export without embedded textures

If you want per-texture control (resolution switching per device, streaming, swappable liveries), use:

```python
export_image_format='NONE',
```

That yields **2.22 MB** — all 7 materials still present with correct names, just no maps attached. Wire them up yourself per §8.

### 4.4 Verify the export

```python
import struct, json, sys
d = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read()
ln = struct.unpack('<I', d[12:16])[0]
j = json.loads(d[20:20+ln])
acc, bv = j['accessors'], j['bufferViews']

print('meshes', len(j['meshes']), 'nodes', len(j['nodes']),
      'mats', len(j.get('materials', [])),
      'images', len(j.get('images', [])),
      'skinned', sum(1 for n in j['nodes'] if 'skin' in n))

for a in j.get('animations', []):
    ts = [acc[s['input']] for s in a['samplers']]
    print(a['name'], len(a['channels']), 'ch',
          round(min(t['min'][0] for t in ts), 3), '->',
          round(max(t['max'][0] for t in ts), 3), 's')

for i, im in enumerate(j.get('images', [])):
    mb = bv[im['bufferView']]['byteLength'] / 1e6 if 'bufferView' in im else 0
    print(f'  img{i:>2} {im.get("name","?"):<48} {round(mb,2)} MB')

for m in j['materials']:
    p = m.get('pbrMetallicRoughness', {})
    print(' ', m['name'], '| alphaMode', m.get('alphaMode', 'OPAQUE'),
          '| slots', [k for k in ('baseColorTexture','metallicRoughnessTexture') if k in p]
                   + [k for k in ('normalTexture','emissiveTexture') if k in m])
```

You must see 10 animation lines and `skinned 0`, and every animation must start at `0.0 s`.

**Also check that no two clips drive the same node** — that check is what catches a bad export:

```python
import struct, json, sys, itertools
d = open(sys.argv[1], 'rb').read()
j = json.loads(d[20:20 + struct.unpack('<I', d[12:16])[0]])
sets = {a['name']: {c['target']['node'] for c in a['channels']} for a in j['animations']}
for x, y in itertools.combinations(sets, 2):
    if sets[x] & sets[y]:
        print('OVERLAP', x, y, len(sets[x] & sets[y]))
print({k: len(v) for k, v in sets.items()})
```

Expected: no `OVERLAP` line, and node counts `Canopy 3 / Main L 1 / Main R 1 / Side L 6 / Side R 6 / Flare L 2 / Flare R 2 / Gear 46 / Hook 4 / Aero 18`.

(Main L/R dropped from 5 nodes to 1 when the main bay door was collapsed onto `Bone.002` alone — see §2.2.)

### 4.5 ⚠️ Node names change once loaded into Three.js

`GLTFLoader` does two things to names:

1. Strips reserved characters `. [ ] : /` → `Bone.009` becomes **`Bone009`**.
2. Deduplicates: all 9 armatures contain `Bone`, `Bone.001`, etc., so they become `Bone`, `Bone_1`, `Bone_2`, … — **unpredictable**.

**Never look up a bone by name.** Look up the mesh (names are unique) and take its `.parent`:

```js
const boneOf = (name) => scene.getObjectByName(name).parent;
const flapL  = boneOf('Wing_Flaperon_L');   // = Bone.009 of RIG_Tail_Nozzle_Hook
```

---

## 5. Loading and setup in Three.js

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';
import { RoomEnvironment } from 'three/addons/environments/RoomEnvironment.js';

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping;

// An environment map is essential — without it metal and glass render nearly black.
const pmrem = new THREE.PMREMGenerator(renderer);
scene.environment = pmrem.fromScene(new RoomEnvironment(), 0.04).texture;

const gltf = await new GLTFLoader().loadAsync('/models/F22_game.glb');
const jet = gltf.scene;
scene.add(jet);

// ONE mixer rooted at the loaded scene — LandingGear_Deploy spans three armatures,
// so a per-armature mixer cannot bind it (§6.1).
const mixer = new THREE.AnimationMixer(jet);

const actions = Object.fromEntries(gltf.animations.map((clip) => {
  const a = mixer.clipAction(clip);
  a.loop = THREE.LoopOnce;
  a.clampWhenFinished = true;     // hold the last frame instead of snapping back
  return [clip.name, a];
}));
// actions.Canopy_Open, actions.LandingGear_Deploy, actions.Tailhook_Deploy, ...
```

With the embedded-texture export (§4.1) **materials arrive ready to use.** Only three things need adjusting:

```js
jet.traverse((o) => {
  if (!o.isMesh) return;
  const m = o.material;

  // 1. Anisotropy — GLTFLoader doesn't set it; fuselage panels blur at grazing angles.
  for (const k of ['map', 'normalMap', 'roughnessMap', 'metalnessMap', 'emissiveMap'])
    if (m[k]) m[k].anisotropy = renderer.capabilities.getMaxAnisotropy();

  // 2. Brighten the cockpit MFD screens.
  if (m.name === 'Interior_Cockpit_Bays') m.emissiveIntensity = 1.2;

  // 3. Canopy glass — always override (see §9).
  if (m.name === 'Glass_Canopy') o.material = makeCanopyGlass(), o.renderOrder = 10;
});
```

If you're loading a KTX2 build (§10), wire the loaders first:

```js
import { KTX2Loader } from 'three/addons/loaders/KTX2Loader.js';
import { MeshoptDecoder } from 'three/addons/libs/meshopt_decoder.module.js';

const ktx2 = new KTX2Loader().setTranscoderPath('/basis/').detectSupport(renderer);
const loaderGLB = new GLTFLoader().setKTX2Loader(ktx2).setMeshoptDecoder(MeshoptDecoder);
```

---

## 6. Driving the animation

### 6.1 Principles

- **One `AnimationMixer`, rooted at `gltf.scene`.** `LandingGear_Deploy` drives three armatures at once, so a per-armature mixer physically cannot bind it. Bone names repeat across rigs, but `GLTFLoader` renames nodes to unique names at load and builds the tracks against those same names — bindings stay correct.
- **No subclipping.** Each clip is already exactly one mechanism, closed → open. `AnimationUtils.subclip()` is no longer needed anywhere.
- **Closing = playing backwards.** `timeScale = -1`. There is no separate close clip, so the two directions can never drift apart.
- **Clips never collide.** The 10 clips share zero nodes (§3), so `actions.Canopy_Open.play()` and `actions.LandingGear_Deploy.play()` at the same time is safe, and neither touches the control surfaces you drive by hand (§7).

### 6.2 Play, reverse, and hold

The minimal form — open, then close by rewinding:

```js
const action = actions.Canopy_Open;

// open
action.reset();
action.timeScale = 1;
action.play();

// close (play backwards)
action.time = action.getClip().duration;
action.timeScale = -1;
action.play();
```

In a game you want to reverse **mid-travel** too (gear retracting while it is still coming down). Then don't `reset()` — just flip `timeScale` and keep the current `time`. `drive()` is meant for *direction changes*: calling it again in the direction a mechanism has already finished travelling is a harmless no-op (the action replays the last fraction of a frame and finishes again).

> The JS in §6.2 and §6.3 is reference code — it was written against the verified clip layout, not executed in a browser here. The clip data itself *was* verified (§3).

```js
function drive(name, open) {
  const a = actions[name];
  const d = a.getClip().duration;

  a.enabled  = true;
  a.paused   = false;
  a.timeScale = open ? 1 : -1;
  // clampWhenFinished parked the action at an end; nudge it back inside the range
  if (open  && a.time >= d) a.time = d - 1e-4;
  if (!open && a.time <= 0) a.time = 1e-4;
  a.play();
}

const canopy = { open: () => drive('Canopy_Open', true), close: () => drive('Canopy_Open', false) };
const gear   = { down: () => drive('LandingGear_Deploy', true), up: () => drive('LandingGear_Deploy', false) };
const hook   = { down: () => drive('Tailhook_Deploy', true), up: () => drive('Tailhook_Deploy', false) };
const bay    = {
  set(open) {
    for (const n of ['WeaponBay_Main_L_Open', 'WeaponBay_Main_R_Open',
                     'WeaponBay_Side_L_Open', 'WeaponBay_Side_R_Open']) drive(n, open);
  },
};
const flares  = {
  set(open) {
    for (const n of ['FlareDispenser_L_Open', 'FlareDispenser_R_Open']) drive(n, open);
  },
};
```

Progress of a mechanism, if you need it for logic (`gear.down === true` before spinning wheels, §7.3):

```js
const progress = (n) => actions[n].time / actions[n].getClip().duration;
```

Speed: change `timeScale` magnitude (`a.timeScale = open ? 2 : -2` = twice as fast). To match a wall-clock duration, use `duration / seconds` as the magnitude.

### 6.2b Scrubbing instead of playing

If you'd rather hold a 0..1 value yourself (physics-driven gear, a slider in a tools UI), keep the action paused and write `time` directly:

```js
function scrub(name, t01) {            // t01 in [0, 1]
  const a = actions[name];
  a.enabled = true;
  a.paused  = true;
  a.play();
  a.time = THREE.MathUtils.clamp(t01, 0, 1) * (a.getClip().duration - 1e-4);
}
mixer.update(0);                       // delta 0 = apply the pose without advancing time
```

> `mixer.setTime(t)` moves **every** action at once and does nothing to paused ones (a paused action has an effective timeScale of 0). With 8 independent mechanisms, per-action `time` is what you want.

### 6.3 State at load — do this, don't skip it

The glTF rest pose is **gear down, canopy open, hook retracted, bays closed** (Blender frame 1). A clip only affects the model once its action has been applied at least once, so pin every mechanism explicitly right after loading:

> `Tailhook_Deploy` already matches the rest pose after §3.3, but keep the `setState(..., CLOSED)` call: the rest of the code (`p()`, `drive()`) reads `action.time`, which is only meaningful once the action has been played.

```js
const CLOSED = 0, OPEN = 1;

function setState(name, v) {
  const a = actions[name];
  const d = a.getClip().duration;
  a.enabled = true;
  a.paused  = true;
  a.play();
  a.time = v === OPEN ? d - 1e-4 : 0;
}

// Parked on the ramp: gear down, canopy open, everything else closed.
setState('LandingGear_Deploy',    OPEN);
setState('Canopy_Open',           OPEN);
setState('Tailhook_Deploy',       CLOSED);
setState('WeaponBay_Main_L_Open', CLOSED);
setState('WeaponBay_Main_R_Open', CLOSED);
setState('WeaponBay_Side_L_Open', CLOSED);
setState('WeaponBay_Side_R_Open', CLOSED);
setState('FlareDispenser_L_Open',  CLOSED);
setState('FlareDispenser_R_Open',  CLOSED);
setState('Aero_Demo',             CLOSED);   // frame 0 = neutral (within 0.33° of rest)

mixer.update(0);                              // apply all of it in one go
```

Skip `Aero_Demo` here if you drive the control surfaces yourself (§7.1) — leave that action alone entirely and the surfaces stay yours.

Then, in your frame loop:

```js
function animate(dt) {
  mixer.update(dt);      // drives every mechanism that is currently in motion
}
```

**Keyboard:**

```js
addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.repeat) return;
  const p = (n) => actions[n].time / actions[n].getClip().duration;
  switch (e.code) {
    case 'KeyG': drive('LandingGear_Deploy', p('LandingGear_Deploy') < 0.5); break;
    case 'KeyB': bay.set(p('WeaponBay_Main_L_Open') < 0.5); break;
    case 'KeyC': drive('Canopy_Open',    p('Canopy_Open')    < 0.5); break;
    case 'KeyH': drive('Tailhook_Deploy', p('Tailhook_Deploy') < 0.5); break;
    case 'KeyF': flares.set(p('FlareDispenser_L_Open') < 0.5); break;
  }
});
```

**Note on direction:** every clip runs closed → open, so `progress 1` always means *deployed*: gear **down**, canopy **up**, hook **down**, bay doors **open**, trapeze **extended**.

---

## 7. Parts you drive yourself (no clips)

### 7.1 Control surfaces — driven by input, not by playing a clip

The `Aero_Demo` clip is eye candy. **Don't play it in game.** Write angles onto the bones from your pitch/roll/yaw input instead.

These bones live in the same rig as the hook, but `Tailhook_Deploy` carries no tracks for them (checked: zero node overlap, §3), so writing over them is safe as long as you never start `Aero_Demo`.
⚠️ If you loaded an older build with a **single merged `Scene` clip**, that clip *does* key these bones and will fight you every frame — stop the mixer before writing angles by hand.

#### The hinge axis is the bone's own axis, not a world axis

🔴 **This is the mistake everyone makes.** Rotating a control surface about a straight world axis looks fine on the stabilators and wrong on everything else, because the real hinge lines are not axis-aligned.

Decompose the showcase clip and every keyed rotation on these ten bones comes out as a **pure rotation about the bone's local Y** — no exception, no off-axis component. Local Y already carries the geometry:

| surface | local Y in body frame | error if you use world `(0,0,1)` / `(0,1,0)` |
|---|---|---|
| `Tail_Stabilator_L/R` | `(0, 0, ∓1)` | 0° — the one case that looks right by luck |
| `Wing_Flaperon_L/R` | `(0.260, 0, ∓0.965)` | **15°** — trailing-edge sweep |
| `Wing_Aileron_L/R` | `(0.269, −0.042, ∓0.962)` | **15°** |
| `Wing_LEFlap_L/R` | `(−0.668, −0.027, ∓0.744)` | **42°** — leading-edge sweep |
| `Tail_VerticalFin_L/R` | `(0.335, 0.816, ∓0.471)` | **28°** — the outward cant |

The nozzle bones are the same story with a different letter: they hinge on their **local X**.

Because the axes mirror between left and right, flip each one against a shared reference so a positive angle means the same thing on both sides.

```js
// helper: hinge a part on its own bone axis, preserving the rest pose.
// Build these at load time, before you apply any attitude rotation to the jet.
function makeHinge(meshName, hingeAxis, reference) {
  const mesh = jet.getObjectByName(meshName);
  const bone = mesh.parent;                        // the bone node
  const rest = bone.quaternion.clone();
  const q = new THREE.Quaternion();

  const axis = hingeAxis.clone();
  const world = axis.clone().applyQuaternion(bone.getWorldQuaternion(new THREE.Quaternion()));
  if (world.dot(reference) < 0) axis.negate();     // point both sides the same way

  return (deg) => bone.quaternion.copy(rest).multiply(q.setFromAxisAngle(axis, deg * Math.PI / 180));
}

const SPAR   = new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0);   // control surfaces hinge on bone local Y
const NOZZLE = new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0);   // nozzle flaps and vanes hinge on bone local X

const STARBOARD = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0,  1);
const UP        = new THREE.Vector3(0, 1,  0);
const PORT      = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1);

const surf = {
  stabL: makeHinge('Tail_Stabilator_L',  SPAR, STARBOARD),
  stabR: makeHinge('Tail_Stabilator_R',  SPAR, STARBOARD),
  flapL: makeHinge('Wing_Flaperon_L',    SPAR, STARBOARD),
  flapR: makeHinge('Wing_Flaperon_R',    SPAR, STARBOARD),
  ailL:  makeHinge('Wing_Aileron_L',     SPAR, STARBOARD),
  ailR:  makeHinge('Wing_Aileron_R',     SPAR, STARBOARD),
  leL:   makeHinge('Wing_LEFlap_L',      SPAR, STARBOARD),
  leR:   makeHinge('Wing_LEFlap_R',      SPAR, STARBOARD),
  rudL:  makeHinge('Tail_VerticalFin_L', SPAR, UP),
  rudR:  makeHinge('Tail_VerticalFin_R', SPAR, UP),
};
```

**With that normalisation, a positive angle always means:** trailing edge **down** on the horizontal surfaces, leading edge **up** on the LE flaps, trailing edge to **starboard** on the vertical tails.

#### Deflection limits, measured

Don't invent numbers — these are the peaks keyed in the showcase. Clamp to them, or a combined pitch + roll + flaps command will punch a surface through the wing.

| surface | limit |
|---|---|
| stabilator | ±20° |
| flaperon | ±22.6° |
| aileron | ±25° |
| LE flap | ±11.4° |
| vertical tail | ±22.6° |

#### Mixing

```js
const clamp = THREE.MathUtils.clamp;

// pitch/roll/yaw in -1..1
function applyControls({ pitch, roll, yaw, flaps = 0 }) {
  // Nose up needs the tail pushed down, so the stabilators — and the flaperons, which
  // act as elevons — go trailing edge UP. Rolling right needs more lift on the left
  // wing, so the LEFT surfaces go trailing edge down. Both tails deflect together for
  // yaw. The LE flaps droop with the flaps, which is negative here.
  surf.stabL(clamp(-pitch * 20 + roll * 8, -20, 20));
  surf.stabR(clamp(-pitch * 20 - roll * 8, -20, 20));
  surf.ailL(clamp( roll * 25, -25, 25));
  surf.ailR(clamp(-roll * 25, -25, 25));
  surf.flapL(clamp(-pitch * 10 + roll * 15 + flaps * 22, -22.6, 22.6));
  surf.flapR(clamp(-pitch * 10 - roll * 15 + flaps * 22, -22.6, 22.6));
  surf.leL(-flaps * 11);
  surf.leR(-flaps * 11);
  surf.rudL(yaw * 22);
  surf.rudR(yaw * 22);
}
```

> **Sanity check, not a guess.** Take the aft-most vertex of each surface and confirm which way it travels: pitch up ⇒ both stabilators TE up; roll right ⇒ left TE down and right TE up; yaw right ⇒ *both* tails TE to starboard; flaps ⇒ flaperons TE down and LE flaps drooped.
> On yaw the left tail's trailing edge also rises while the right one dips. **That is not a bug** — it is what a 28°-canted all-moving tail does when it rotates about its own spar.

### 7.2 Thrust vectoring nozzles

8 parts (upper/lower flap + upper/lower vane, × left/right). They hinge on **bone local X**, not the wing-span axis.

Normalise them against `PORT` and a positive angle means trailing edge **up** on all eight — i.e. the exhaust turns up, the tail is pushed down, the nose goes up.

```js
const nz = {
  LFlapU: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_L_Flap_Upper', NOZZLE, PORT),
  LFlapD: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_L_Flap_Lower', NOZZLE, PORT),
  LVaneU: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_L_Vane_Upper', NOZZLE, PORT),
  LVaneD: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_L_Vane_Lower', NOZZLE, PORT),
  RFlapU: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_R_Flap_Upper', NOZZLE, PORT),
  RFlapD: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_R_Flap_Lower', NOZZLE, PORT),
  RVaneU: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_R_Vane_Upper', NOZZLE, PORT),
  RVaneD: makeHinge('Engine_Nozzle_R_Vane_Lower', NOZZLE, PORT),
};

// One engine. v = -1..1, positive turns the exhaust up.
function vectorEngine(v, flapU, flapD, vaneU, vaneD) {
  const up = Math.max(v, 0), down = Math.max(-v, 0);
  flapU(up * 20 - down *  8);
  flapD(up *  8 - down * 20);
  vaneU(up * -10);
  vaneD(down * 10);
}

// vec = pitch vectoring, diff = roll vectoring
function applyVector(vec, diff = 0) {
  vectorEngine(THREE.MathUtils.clamp(vec - diff, -1, 1), nz.LFlapU, nz.LFlapD, nz.LVaneU, nz.LVaneD);
  vectorEngine(THREE.MathUtils.clamp(vec + diff, -1, 1), nz.RFlapU, nz.RFlapD, nz.RVaneU, nz.RVaneD);
}
```

The 20 / 8 / 10 numbers are the showcase's own, read off frames 381–700 and **exactly mirrored** between the up and down phases:

| frame | flap upper | flap lower | vane upper | vane lower |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 420 (turning up) | +20° | +8° | +10° | 0° |
| 500 (turning down) | −8° | −20° | 0° | −10° |

(Angles as keyed, about each bone's local X. Note the vane always moves *opposite* to the flap on its side — it closes as the flap opens.)

From frame 542 the left and right engines run opposite sign at the same magnitude — that is the roll vectoring, and it is exactly what `diff` reproduces. For a right roll the **left** engine turns its exhaust down to lift that wing, hence `vec - diff` on the left.

### 7.3 Wheel spin — find the axis empirically

Wheels are plain mesh nodes under a bone, so you can rotate them directly. But **their local axis is not predictable** — rest transforms shift into bone space during export. Derive the axis from the world basis instead:

```js
function makeSpinner(meshName, worldAxis = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1)) {
  const w = jet.getObjectByName(meshName);
  const local = worldAxis.clone()
    .applyQuaternion(w.getWorldQuaternion(new THREE.Quaternion()).invert())
    .normalize();
  return (rad) => w.rotateOnAxis(local, rad);
}

const spinNose = makeSpinner('NLG_Wheel');
const spinL    = makeSpinner('MLG_Wheel_L');
const spinR    = makeSpinner('MLG_Wheel_R');

// in the loop: omega = speed / radius
const RADIUS_MAIN = 0.11, RADIUS_NOSE = 0.066;   // Blender units
function spinWheels(speed, dt) {
  spinL(speed / RADIUS_MAIN * dt);
  spinR(speed / RADIUS_MAIN * dt);
  spinNose(speed / RADIUS_NOSE * dt);
}
```

**If a wheel spins in the wrong plane,** try `(1,0,0)` → `(0,1,0)` → `(0,0,1)` and keep whichever looks right. Thirty seconds of trial beats deriving it on paper.

⚠️ Don't spin wheels while a gear clip is playing. The clip writes the bone (parent) and you write the mesh (child), so they don't collide — but accumulated spin looks wrong as the leg folds. Spin only when `progress('LandingGear_Deploy') > 0.99`.

---

## 8. Textures (Optional — only if you load them yourself)

> **With the embedded-texture export (§4.1) you can skip this entire section** — GLTFLoader wires up maps, colorSpace, flipY and alphaMode correctly on its own.
>
> Read on only if you exported with `export_image_format='NONE'` (§4.3) because you want to:
> - switch texture resolution per device tier
> - stream textures later (ship the 3.5 MB model first, fill in textures after)
> - swap liveries / skins at runtime
> - use your own ORM packing or texture atlas

### 8.0 What's actually in the files

Every file is a **PNG with no alpha channel** (plain RGB or grayscale) — there is no alpha to strip.

| map type | bit depth | size |
|---|---|---|
| Base color, Emissive | 8-bit RGB | 4096² (Weapons 1024²) |
| Metallic, Roughness, Opacity | 8-bit grayscale | 4096² |
| **Normal** | **16-bit RGB** | 4096² |
| Height (unused) | 16-bit grayscale | 4096² |

⚠️ 16-bit normals double the file size, but every GPU block format is 8-bit — convert to 8-bit before encoding.

Transparency lives in **separate opacity maps** (Substance Painter style), not in an alpha channel.
Measured coverage: `Cabin_Opacity` is 97.1% white / 1.0% black; `Landing_gear_Opacity` is **99.2% white with no black at all**.
⇒ They barely do anything. Try disabling them; if you see no difference, drop them — that's two fewer textures and no fragment discard.

### 8.1 Material table

7 materials; files live in `textures/`.

| material | meshes | Base color | Metallic | Roughness | Normal | other |

### 8.2 Rules people get wrong

1. **`flipY = false` on every texture** — glTF uses the opposite UV convention from `TextureLoader`'s default. Forget it and everything is upside down.
2. **colorSpace**: `SRGBColorSpace` on base color and emissive only. The other four (metalness / roughness / normal / alpha) stay linear (default).
3. 🔴 **Set `metalness = 1.0` and `roughness = 1.0` whenever the matching map is assigned** — Three.js **multiplies** the scalar by the map. Blender's scalars are metallic 0.0 / roughness 0.5; copying those across while also assigning maps yields an aircraft with no metallic response at all.
4. **No need to pack ORM** — Three.js reads `.g` from `roughnessMap` and `.b` from `metalnessMap`; grayscale files already have r=g=b, so separate files work as-is.
5. **`Airframe_Exterior` has no roughness file** → use a scalar of ~0.45.
6. **Opacity maps → `alphaMap` + `alphaTest`**, not `transparent: true` (Blender's blend mode is HASHED, i.e. alpha clip).
7. **Normal maps are OpenGL convention (+Y), which already matches glTF.** No channel flip.
8. **Multi-material meshes become Groups** — `Canopy_Glass` and ~20 others (`Bay_Center_Door_L`, `MLG_L_Door`, `NLG_Door_Rail_L`…) export as 2 primitives, so `getObjectByName('Canopy_Glass').material` is `undefined`. **Traverse and switch on the material name instead.**

## 9. Canopy glass

In Blender, `Glass_Canopy` is alpha 0.30, roughness 0.05, **metallic 0.85**, IOR 1.45, blend mode BLEND.
Those values can't be ported literally: in the PBR model **metals don't transmit light**, so high metalness and transmission fight each other. Pick one approach.

**What the exporter emits:** this material has no textures, so it exports as `baseColorFactor [0.30, 0.21, 0.09, 0.30]`, `metallicFactor 0.85`, `roughnessFactor 0.05`, `alphaMode: BLEND`, plus the `KHR_materials_ior` (1.45) and `KHR_materials_specular` extensions.
GLTFLoader builds a `MeshPhysicalMaterial` from that, but with **no transmission** (Blender's value is 0) and `depthWrite` still true, so the canopy occludes the cockpit. **Always override it in JS.**

`Canopy_Glass` has two material slots (`Details_Exterior_Fittings` = frame, `Glass_Canopy` = glass), so it arrives as a Group of 2 meshes. `applyMaterials` above handles that.

### Option A — tinted metal (recommended for a game; no extra pass)

Reproduces the F-22's gold ITO coating and stays cheap.

```js
function makeCanopyGlass() {
  return new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
    name: 'Glass_Canopy',
    color: 0xb98a3f,          // gold indium-tin-oxide coating
    metalness: 1.0,
    roughness: 0.05,
    transparent: true,
    opacity: 0.28,
    envMapIntensity: 2.0,
    side: THREE.DoubleSide,
    depthWrite: false,        // otherwise it occludes the cockpit interior
  });
}
// always draw after opaque geometry
jet.traverse(o => { if (o.isMesh && o.material?.name === 'Glass_Canopy') o.renderOrder = 10; });
```

### Option B — physical transmission (better looking, more expensive)

```js
function makeCanopyGlass() {
  return new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
    name: 'Glass_Canopy',
    color: 0xffffff,
    metalness: 0.0,           // must be 0 for transmission to work
    roughness: 0.03,
    transmission: 1.0,
    thickness: 0.02,          // model units (~1 cm real)
    ior: 1.45,                // matches Blender
    attenuationColor: 0xd4af5a,
    attenuationDistance: 0.5,
    iridescence: 1.0,         // gold sheen
    iridescenceIOR: 1.3,
    iridescenceThicknessRange: [100, 400],
    envMapIntensity: 1.5,
    side: THREE.DoubleSide,
    depthWrite: false,
  });
}
```

⚠️ `transmission > 0` makes Three.js render the scene again into a render target every frame — heavy on mobile.
⚠️ **Both options require `scene.environment`.** With no env map the canopy is pure black.

## 10. Optimization — 53.52 MB is not shippable

The master export embeds PNGs and weighs **53.52 MB**, but the number that actually kills a game is VRAM:
**one uncompressed 4096×4096 RGBA texture is ~89 MB on the GPU** (mipmaps included), **each**.
The file has 19 of them, mostly 4096² → over 1 GB of VRAM untouched. Mid-range hardware will not survive.

PNG is only compressed on disk; once decoded it uploads raw. **KTX2 is the only format that stays compressed on the GPU.**

Install once:

```bash
npm i -g @gltf-transform/cli
```

### Option A — Simple (one command)

```bash
gltf-transform etc1s F22_master.glb F22_game.glb --quality 200
```

Converts every texture to **ETC1S** (Basis Universal) — roughly 6–8× smaller, transcodes on every platform.
Good for: prototyping, seeing results fast, when normal-map quality isn't critical yet.

Downside: ETC1S visibly **wrecks normal maps** — banding shows up in the shading, because it lossily crushes two channels that need precision.

### Option B — Advanced (codec per map type)

```bash
# 1) prune unused data and downscale first (fast)
gltf-transform prune  F22_master.glb F22_1.glb
gltf-transform dedup  F22_1.glb      F22_2.glb
gltf-transform resize F22_2.glb      F22_3.glb --width 2048 --height 2048

# 2) normals → UASTC
gltf-transform uastc F22_3.glb F22_4.glb \
  --slots "normalTexture" \
  --level 4 --rdo --rdo-lambda 1 --verbose

# 3) everything else → ETC1S
gltf-transform etc1s F22_4.glb F22_5.glb --quality 200 --verbose

# 4) geometry
gltf-transform meshopt F22_5.glb F22_game.glb --level high

rm F22_1.glb F22_2.glb F22_3.glb F22_4.glb F22_5.glb
```

What each step does:

| step | command | effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `prune` | removes unreferenced materials / textures / meshes / nodes (e.g. a stray Height map) |
| | `dedup` | merges byte-identical accessors, textures and materials into single instances |
| | `resize` | downscales every texture to 2048² — **must run before encoding**, since you can't downscale afterwards; cuts VRAM 4× immediately |
| 2 | `uastc --slots normalTexture` | normals use **UASTC** — far higher fidelity than ETC1S, no banding, at ~4× the size. `--rdo` improves gzip compression at almost no quality cost |
| 3 | `etc1s --quality 200` | everything else (base color, ORM, emissive) uses **ETC1S** — smallest, and artifacts in albedo are essentially invisible |
| 4 | `meshopt --level high` | compresses vertex and index buffers (39k tris) and decodes faster than Draco |

Why split them: ETC1S and UASTC are both Basis, but ETC1S optimizes for size and UASTC for accuracy.
**Base color being slightly off is invisible; a normal map being slightly off throws the shading of the whole airframe.**

`--slots` matches glTF slot names: `baseColorTexture`, `normalTexture`, `metallicRoughnessTexture`, `emissiveTexture`, `occlusionTexture`.

### Three.js side

Both options need `KTX2Loader` (plus `MeshoptDecoder` for option B) — see the code in §5.
Copy the Basis transcoder into your public directory:

```bash
cp -r node_modules/three/examples/jsm/libs/basis public/basis
```

### Cut what isn't visible

`Interior_Cockpit_Bays` covers 144 meshes (the entire cockpit and bay interiors). For an exterior-only game, hide the cockpit while the canopy is closed:

```js
const cockpit = [];
jet.traverse(o => { if (o.isMesh && o.name.startsWith('Cockpit_')) cockpit.push(o); });
// in the loop: cockpit.forEach(o => o.visible = progress('Canopy_Open') > 0.01 || cameraIsClose);
```

### Disable frustum culling on bone-driven parts

If pieces pop out of view while the gear folds:

```js
jet.traverse(o => { if (o.isMesh) o.frustumCulled = false; });
```

---

## 11. Main loop

```js
const clock = new THREE.Clock();

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  const dt = Math.min(clock.getDelta(), 0.05);   // guard against tab-switch spikes

  mixer.update(dt);                               // all mechanisms
  applyControls(input);                           // control surfaces
  applyVector(input.pitch, input.roll * 0.5);     // nozzles
  if (progress('LandingGear_Deploy') > 0.99) spinWheels(groundSpeed, dt);

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

---

## 12. Pre-ship checklist

- [ ] Reset pose bones + `frame_set(1)` before every export (rest pose must be stable)
- [ ] `export_def_bones=False` — forget it and all animation is gone
- [ ] `export_optimize_animation_keep_anim_armature=False` — otherwise clips on the same rig fight each other
- [ ] `export_frame_range=False` — the clips start at frame 0, the scene range at frame 1
- [ ] No active action on the rigs at export time (clips live on muted NLA tracks)
- [ ] Verify the GLB with the §4.4 scripts: expect 10 animations, `skinned 0`, **no `OVERLAP` line**
- [ ] Never look up bones by name — use `mesh.parent`
- [ ] One `AnimationMixer` on `gltf.scene` — `LandingGear_Deploy` spans three armatures
- [ ] Hinge control surfaces on the bone's own **local Y** (nozzles: local **X**) — never a world axis
- [ ] `WeaponBay_Side_*` already includes the missile trapeze — don't also drive the AIM-9 by hand
- [ ] Pin every mechanism with `setState()` + `mixer.update(0)` once loading completes
- [ ] `scene.environment` must exist or glass and metal render black
- [ ] Override the `Glass_Canopy` material and set its `renderOrder`
- [ ] Set `anisotropy` on textures (GLTFLoader doesn't)
- [ ] **Never ship `F22_master.glb`** — run §10 to produce `F22_game.glb`
- [ ] Wire up `KTX2Loader` and copy `basis/` into public
- [ ] *(manual-texture path only)* `flipY = false` everywhere, `metalness/roughness = 1.0` wherever a map is assigned
